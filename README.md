Learning to use GitHub


Well well well, here we are using GitHub for the first time!

I would date this, but the commit will do that for me.

The question is, after how long from right now will I be so different that I won't recognize 
 this writing as from me! (The assumptions is never :-) )
  
  
  
  
  And for all the private investigators browsing through my online footprint, GO AWAY!
